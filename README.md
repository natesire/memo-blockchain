# SingletonSire

Blockchain built by two friends in Python3 (Julia planned too) that aims to create coins with intrinsic value based on data blocks that store valuable scientific data. Written in a chat-bot command line style program with easy to use commands so anyone can start using it. The customer user is always #1. We named this after Mike Singleton and Nate Sire. Mike's inspiration was to create a geo-based singleton instance where one block could only exist in one place on the planet yet be verified by anyone. Nate's inspiration was to help developers earn royalties from helping the community solve climate change by data crunching on quantum computing scienctific algorithms and by contributing different value levels of data based on real estate.

# Plans for Concurrency

We will explore using CGO, as in C with Go, to call Golang from Python through C language in order to leverage Golang's awesome CSP (communicating sequential processes) concurrency model. This will drastically speed up our block=chain processing throughput by vertical scaling on one super computer. One Node location will be able to utilize all of their CPU cores to data crypto mine. Think of your computer as the centralized piece of the blockchain which improves performance beyond a strictly decentralized traditional block-chain like Bitcoin. The person with the largest super computer in one geographic location will lead in mining and solving scientific problems. This also discourages botnets and hackers from stealing cloud services to do mining since this is geo-location based.

# Development Environment

Python 3.8

# Troubleshooting

I developed this prototype on the Windows Ubuntu WSL Subsystem
