# SingletonSire

Blockchain built by two friends in Python3 (Julia planned too) that aims to create coins with intrinsic value based on data blocks that store valuable scientific data. Written in a chat-bot command line style program with easy to use commands so anyone can start using it. The customer user is always #1. We named this after Mike Singleton and Nate Sire. Mike's inspiration was to create a geo-based singleton instance where one block could only exist in one place on the planet yet be verified by anyone. Nate's inspiration was to help developers earn royalties from helping the community solve climate change by data crunching on quantum computing scienctific algorithms and by contributing different value levels of data based on real estate.
